# PaperClip ‚Äì Paper Knowledge Management Tool

PaperClip is a _**literature knowledge management tool**_ for **_academic researchers_**, helping them dig out valuable knowledge from readings and notes, assist thinking and analysis, and support the research process like topic selection. Its mental model is the zettelkasten card box note-taking method, and knowledge graph technology supports its function.

## üìö Research

---

In the research process, researchers need to deal with a large amount of literary knowledge and explore and discover. And knowledge graph technology can translate knowledge in the Internet and academic literature into a data format that is more suitable for human cognition and machine processing. Therefore, I try to apply knowledge graph technology to interaction design to assist the knowledge management of literature research.
