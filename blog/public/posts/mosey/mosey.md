# MOSEY – 2030 Driving Experience Design

**_“Mosey is a Future Driving Experience Design based on Human-machine Symbiosis”_**

In 2030, Autopilot is between L3 and L4 stage, and the driver canâ€™t leave his or her attention completely away from driving. The relationship between the driver and the car will be blurred, and the trust in the vehicle will gradually decrease. So we tried to create a new human-vehicle relationship in which the user will develop a special understanding with his car to achieve the purpose of human-computer symbiosis.
